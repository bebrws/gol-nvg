# What is it?

A Conway's Game Of Life implementation in Rust using he nvg rust library.

I thought this library looked amazing. And it is pretty awesome.

But it does seem to be a bad choice if you are looking for a high frame rate which is what I am testing out differant graphics libraries for right now.

This nvg library deffinately wins when it comes to usability though. It is crazy simple to put somethign together with this.
